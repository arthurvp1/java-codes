# Java Development Journey

This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey in Java development. All the code provided is designed to run from the terminal.

## Overview

This repository contains various Java programs and exercises that I have worked on. Each piece of code is intended to be executed from the command line and demonstrates different aspects of Java programming.

## Contents

- **/src**: Contains Java source code files organized by project or exercise.
- **/docs**: Documentation or notes related to specific projects (optional).
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Java programs in this repository, you will need:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that the JDK is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (or from the corresponding version).

### Running the Code

1. Navigate to the `src` directory where the Java code is located.
2. Compile the code using the command:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
